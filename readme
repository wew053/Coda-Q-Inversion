The following steps are the general steps to run the codes
1. coda_section.m: derives the coda sections from the seismograms.
2. coda_correction.m: finds the linear regression coefficient > 0.9
3. remove_eve_sta_crit: removes the stations or event who has not enough records.
4. inv_coda_Q_section.m: computes the coda-Q from differents coda-Q models.
5. parameter_fraction_inversion.m: computes the importance of each part in the coda eq.

PS:
(1). cal_ms_coda_q.m: computes the smoothed squared seismograms from raw data.
(2). hann_taper.m: hanning taper code
(3). file_reorder_inversion: to give subindex to events and stations used in inversion
(4). countmember.m: counts members in arrays, credit by Jos van der Geest
(5). readsac.m: reads the sacfiles, credit by Xiaoning Yang

eve_*Hz.txt: contains the source-side results at * Hz.
